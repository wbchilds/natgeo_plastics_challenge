                        We have designed this facts & data project in a visual and interactive way,
                        to help everyone understand the extent of plastic pollution. Increasing awareness is key to drive change and to find solutions for preserving our oceans.
                        Because preserving our oceans is essential to preserve our own species.

                        Plastic pollution has been around <b>only since the 1950s</b>, it has been incredibly useful for many human needs, mostly for it's quality of long-lasting.
                        But that exact quality has made it the most dangerous material for biodiversity when it comes to public waste.
                        Here we put together data from the latest research to help everyone of us see the reality of the problem and also to start being part of the solution,
                        at whatever scale suits your personal lifestyle.
